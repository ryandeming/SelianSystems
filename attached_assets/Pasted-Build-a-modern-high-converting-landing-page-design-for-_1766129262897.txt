Build a modern, high-converting landing page design for a company called “Selian Systems.”  

Selian Systems helps contractors (plumbers, electricians, roofers, HVAC techs, etc.) get and convert more leads using simple marketing and CRM tools.  
The website should feel bold, confident, and contractor-friendly — no corporate stock-photo vibes, no fluff, just clean design and strong messaging.

**Design details:**
- Overall theme: Navy blue (#0A1931) as primary background color, paired with white text and bright accent colors like orange (#FF914D) or yellow for CTAs.  
- Font style: Bold, readable sans-serif (like Inter, Montserrat, or Poppins).  
- Imagery: Use background photos of contractors working (realistic, authentic) and icons representing calls, websites, messages, and reviews.  
- Layout:  
  - Hero section with headline, subheadline, and CTA (“Book a Call”).  
  - Following sections that visually break up into cards or strips for each feature:
      - Functional Website  
      - Review System  
      - Missed Call Text-Back  
      - Marketing Campaigns  
      - Local SEO  
  - Include a 3-step “How It Works” timeline and a “Why Choose Us” feature block with simple icons.  
  - End with a CTA banner (“Stop missing leads. Start closing jobs.”).  
- Buttons: Rounded edges, bold accent color (orange or yellow), hover effects.  
- Typography: Headlines large and confident, body text medium weight with good contrast against the navy background.  
- Mobile responsive design required.  
- Include smooth scrolling and anchor links to sections from top nav.  
- Keep spacing generous and layout simple — everything should feel rugged, functional, and easy to read.

**Tone and vibe:**  
Professional but laid-back. No marketing jargon. The website should feel like it was built for people who prefer tools over tech.  

End result: A strong, contractor-friendly landing page design with a navy-blue color scheme, bold typography, and easy call-to-action flow focused on lead generation.
